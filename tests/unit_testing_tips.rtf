\
'''\
\
We want to test our functions in a way that is repeatable and automated. \
Ideally, we'd run a test program that runs all our unit tests and cleanly lets us know which ones failed and which ones succeeded. \
There are great tools available in Python that we can use to create effective unit tests: pytest	\
\
The advantage of unit tests is that they are isolated from the rest of your program, and thus, no dependencies are involved. \
They don't require access to databases, APIs, or other external sources of information. \
However, passing unit tests isn\'92t always enough to prove that our program is working successfully. \
\
To show that all the parts of our program work with each other properly, \
communicating and transferring data between them correctly, we use integration tests.\
